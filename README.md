# Token Vesting dApp

This is my another proof-of-work on the [Solana Developer Bootcamp 2024](https://youtu.be/amAq-WHAFs8?si=fftlRBl93mC8PJJT&t=20895). This time I created a token vesting application on solana which can do these 3 things:

- **Create Vesting Account**: Set up a vesting account for a company, specifying the company name and associated accounts.
- **Create Employee Vesting**: Establish a vesting schedule for an employee, including start and end times, total amount, and a cliff period.
- **Claim Tokens**: Allows employees to claim their vested tokens after the cliff period, based on the time elapsed and the amount vested.
